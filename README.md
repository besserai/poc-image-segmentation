# Proof of Concept for Image Segmentation in a React app

The project uses the [@techstark/opencv-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@techstark/opencv-js) library and reimplements with it the [OpenCV.js image segmentation tutorial](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/dc/d20/tutorial_js_semantic_segmentation.html) to be able to perform DNN based image segmentation in a browser.

# Installation

Just clone the Repo and `npm start` to run the local server.
